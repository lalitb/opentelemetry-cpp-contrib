# OpenTelemetry C++ Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry C++ contributions that are not part of the [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp) and core distribution of the API and SDK.

## Contributing

News PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on [CODEOWNERS](./.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner's detailed review of the code when making the final approval decision.
